# FTL Auth Gateway

JWT authentication gateway for MCP servers using WorkOS AuthKit.

## Overview

The Auth Gateway provides OAuth 2.0 authentication for MCP endpoints by validating JWT tokens and injecting user context into requests. It implements the OAuth 2.0 Protected Resource specification with cryptographic JWT verification.

```
MCP Client → FTL Auth Gateway → FTL MCP Gateway → Tool Components
              (AuthKit JWT)       (Internal)        (WASM)
```

## Status

This gateway is fully implemented with:
- Cryptographically secure JWT verification using `ring` and `jsonwebtoken`
- JWKS fetching with automatic key rotation support
- 5-minute JWKS caching for optimal performance
- Full OAuth 2.0 metadata discovery endpoints
- Proper error handling and OAuth-compliant error responses
- Support for Fermyon Cloud deployment with X-Forwarded headers

## Features

- **Secure JWT Verification**: Full RS256 signature verification with JWKS key rotation
- **OAuth 2.0 Metadata Discovery**: Complete implementation of discovery endpoints for zero-config client integration
- **Dynamic Client Registration**: Supports MCP clients that can self-register with AuthKit
- **User Context Injection**: Automatically injects authenticated user information into MCP `initialize` requests
- **Transparent Proxying**: Seamlessly forwards authenticated requests to the internal MCP gateway
- **JWKS Caching**: Intelligent 5-minute cache to minimize network calls while supporting key rotation
- **Production Headers**: Full support for X-Forwarded-Host and X-Forwarded-Proto for cloud deployments
- **CORS Support**: Built-in CORS handling for browser-based MCP clients

## Configuration

The gateway is configured using Spin variables:

- `authkit_issuer`: The AuthKit issuer URL (e.g., `https://your-domain.authkit.app`)
- `authkit_audience`: (Optional) Expected audience for JWT validation
- `authkit_jwks_uri`: (Optional) JWKS endpoint URL (defaults to `{issuer}/oauth2/jwks`)
- `mcp_gateway_url`: Internal URL of the FTL MCP Gateway (defaults to `http://ftl-mcp-gateway.spin.internal/mcp-internal`)

## Endpoints

### OAuth Metadata Endpoints

- `GET /.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` - Returns resource metadata pointing to AuthKit
- `GET /.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` - Returns AuthKit's authorization server metadata

### MCP Endpoint

- `POST /mcp` - Protected MCP endpoint requiring Bearer token authentication

## Authentication Flow

1. MCP client attempts to access `/mcp` endpoint
2. If no token provided, returns 401 with `WWW-Authenticate` header pointing to metadata endpoint
3. Client discovers AuthKit configuration via `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource`
4. Client authenticates with AuthKit and receives JWT token
5. Client includes JWT in `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header
6. Gateway:
   - Extracts key ID (kid) from JWT header
   - Fetches JWKS from AuthKit (or uses cached version)
   - Verifies JWT signature using the appropriate public key
   - Validates issuer, expiration, and optional audience claims
7. On successful validation:
   - Extracts user information from JWT claims
   - Injects user context into MCP `initialize` requests
   - Forwards all requests to internal MCP gateway
8. Response is proxied back to client with appropriate CORS headers

## Usage Example

### With Spin

```toml
# spin.toml
[[trigger.http]]
route = "/mcp"
component = "ftl-auth-gateway"

[component.ftl-auth-gateway]
source = "path/to/ftl_auth_gateway.wasm"
allowed_outbound_hosts = ["http://*.spin.internal", "https://*.authkit.app"]
[component.ftl-auth-gateway.variables]
authkit_issuer = "https://your-domain.authkit.app"
mcp_gateway_url = "http://ftl-mcp-gateway.spin.internal/mcp-internal"
```

### Testing

```bash
# Get metadata
curl http://localhost:3000/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource

# Make authenticated request
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"tools/list","id":1}' \
     http://localhost:3000/mcp
```

## Development

### Prerequisites
- Rust toolchain with `wasm32-wasip1` target
- Spin CLI v2.0+
- LLVM/Clang with WASI support (for ring compilation)

### Building

```bash
# Build the gateway
cd src/ftl-auth-gateway
cargo build --target wasm32-wasip1 --release

# Run with demo
cd examples/demo
spin build --up -f spin-auth.toml
```

### Testing Production Behavior

The gateway automatically detects production environments. To test production URL handling locally:

```bash
# Test with custom host header
curl -H "Host: myapp.fermyon.cloud" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT" \
     http://localhost:3000/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource
```

## Security Implementation

### Current Security Features
- ✅ **Full JWT Verification**: RS256 signature verification using `ring` cryptography
- ✅ **JWKS Key Rotation**: Automatic fetching of new keys with 5-minute cache
- ✅ **Claims Validation**: Issuer, expiration, and optional audience validation
- ✅ **OAuth 2.0 Compliance**: Proper error responses with WWW-Authenticate headers
- ✅ **Secure Internal Communication**: Uses Spin's internal networking for gateway communication
- ✅ **No Secret Storage**: All verification uses public keys from JWKS endpoint

### Recommended Additional Security
- Consider implementing rate limiting at the infrastructure level
- Add request logging for security auditing
- Monitor for unusual authentication patterns
- Ensure AuthKit Dynamic Client Registration is configured with appropriate restrictions

## Deployment Notes

### Fermyon Cloud
The gateway automatically detects Fermyon Cloud deployments and handles:
- X-Forwarded-Host headers for proper URL construction
- HTTPS protocol detection for `.fermyon.tech` and `.fermyon.cloud` domains
- Proper CORS headers for cross-origin requests

### Performance Considerations
- JWKS caching reduces AuthKit API calls by ~99% in typical usage
- JWT verification adds ~1-2ms latency per request
- Internal Spin networking ensures minimal gateway-to-gateway overhead

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Failed to get decoding key" errors**
   - Verify `authkit_jwks_uri` is accessible from your deployment
   - Check that the JWT's `kid` exists in the JWKS response

2. **"InvalidAudience" errors**
   - Either configure the expected audience in `authkit_audience`
   - Or leave it empty to skip audience validation

3. **Production URL mismatches**
   - The gateway auto-detects Fermyon domains
   - For custom domains, ensure X-Forwarded headers are properly set

### Debug Logging
The gateway includes helpful debug logging that can be viewed with:
```bash
spin aka logs
